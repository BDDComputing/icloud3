iCloud3 v2.2.2rc5 Change Log
------------------------------
1. Did a lot of tunning to remove unnecessary iCloud account authentications.
2. The email from Apple about someone signing on to the iCloud account should only occur when starting HA or when selecting Event Log > Actions > Reset iCloud Interface.
3. Fixed a misspelling of self.format_age that was generating an error. It should be self._format_age.

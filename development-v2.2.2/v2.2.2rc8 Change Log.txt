iCloud3 v2.2.2rc8b Change Log
------------------------------

2. Added debug trace code to the _update_location routine

iCloud3 v2.2.2rc8 Change Log
------------------------------
1. The Find-my-Friends (fmf) and the Family Sharing (famshr) have been combined into a single tracking method (icloud) and operates on a per device basis. When iCloud3 starts, the FindMy People list is analyzed for devices to be tracked, followed by the FindMy Me selection (this device is My Location), followed by the Family sharing list. You no longer need to assign a tracking method to use iCloud Location Services. Each device you are tracking will automatically select the appropriate tracking method based on how it is set up in your iCloud account.
2. Changed the list in Stage 2 of iCloud3 initialization to show all the people and devices in the FindMy app and all the devices in the Family Sharing list. A check mark is next to the track_device in your configuration parameters indicating the tracking method selected for that device.
3. Changed the default for the 'ignore_inzone_gps_accuracy' from True to False to prevent wild gps accuracy issues taking you out of a zone.
4. Code cleanup.
5. TODO - Further analysis of pyicloud_ic3 data requests for the fmf and famshr support. There is some tuning to be done, reviewing the data returned to make sure unnecessary requests are not being made and investigate the possibility of only requesting location data for the devices that need it rather than every device.

2. The email from Apple about someone signing on to the iCloud account should only occur when starting HA or when selecting Event Log > Actions > Reset iCloud Interface.

4. Fixed a problem occuring when the name of the phone was 'iPhone'.

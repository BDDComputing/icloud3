# Preparing for iCloud3

This chapter explains how to:

- Decide what tracking method you want to use.
- Set up iCloud account for the Find-My-Friends tracking method using the iPhone's FindMy App or for the Family Sharing tracking method using the iPhone's Settings App.

### iCloud3 Tracking Methods

The previous chapter described the tracking methods you can use.

- **Find-My-Friends (fmf)** - Uses the people that you are sharing your location with on the FindMy App. This is probably most efficient method to use in regards of how iCloud locates devices and lets you  track people that are not on your Family Sharing List.
- **Family Sharing (famshr)** - The people you want to track are on your Family Sharing list on your iCloud account, along with other Apple devices you don't want to track. Remember, when you use this tracking method, iCloud will locate all of the devices whether you are tracking them or not.

#### Find-My-Friends Tracking Method and the The FindMy app

The Find-my-Friends (FmF) tracking method locates the people you have set up on iPhone's ```FindMy App > People``` screen. When they are added, their iCloud account email address adds the phone to the *Share Location* list and is used on the iCloud3 track_devices parameter. 

The person's email address ties the phone being tracked on the iCloud3 track_devices parameter (*gary_iphone*)  to the person on the Share My Location list (*gary-icloud-acct@email.com*).

1. Open the FindMy App.
2. Select **People**. Then select **+ Share My Location**.
3. This will open the *Share My Location* popup window. Select the person to add to the list using their mobile phone number or their email address.
4. Select **Send** to send a sharing invitation to that person. They be added to the list after they accept the invitation. 
5. Verify that Location Sharing is on turned on their iPhone.
